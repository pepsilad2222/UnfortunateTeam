# UnfortunateTeam

what am I good at?
I am good at communicating and getting all tasks required of me done. This is an integral part of a team that can lead to success.

how do I perform?
I perform responsibility well. Whatever the due date is I will complete the task beforehand.

what do I value?
I value good, ethical teamworkâ€”people who talk and communicate through problems.

what contribution can be expected from me on this project?
Whatever is asked of me to be done will be done. I will try to get it to close to, if not, perfection to the best of my ability.

Projects can fail because of the people in the team and their inabiity to gel and communicate; that will not happen as Nathan and I will keep eachother responsible.
