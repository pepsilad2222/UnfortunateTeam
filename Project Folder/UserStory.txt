Did the game start successfully after following the instructions?
Yes

If No, describe the issue: N/A

Initial Impressions:
As of now it look understandable.

What were your first thoughts when the game started?
A bit confused. There was no background no context as to got where I was. I sort of just appeared and did things. It was a little confusing.

Were the instructions clear on how to play the game?
No

If No, what was unclear?
I dont think there were any instructions, but it would not be a bad idea to have them. I was a little confused as to move to different places.

Maze Navigation:

How easy was it to understand the maze navigation mechanics (choosing paths, directions)?
Yes

If Yes, what happened?
Even though there are signs saying you went in the right direction overall, it was still confsuing. The text was al bunched up and I was lost.


Did you complete the maze successfully?
Yes


Suggestions for Improvement:

What improvements would you suggest for the game?
I have a few, introduce some context, background info, maybe also include more of the game so the game doesnt end after the maze ends. 
I also feel like the person should just type out a command instead of pressing a number.
