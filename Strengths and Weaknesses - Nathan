# UnfortunateTeam


what am I good at?
What I can be good at in a team project is being able to be a good listener and being able to 
take what I heard and work on implementing a solution for it. Also I am good at researching things that can be helpful for the project

how do I perform?
I perform more as someone that wants to do a project in smaller sections, so that each element of the project could exist and work
independently of the other sections. Also, keeping the goals we have organized is an important aspect of having a successful team.

what do I value?
I value being part of a team that can have its members focused on their own part, but also have everyone be able to help each other.
This allows people in the team to be able to find solutions quicker than if they did not have help.

what contribution can be expected from me on this project?
The group can expect me to be able to keep things organized and be able to split up the goals that we need to achieve. Also working on coding the actual pieces of the project.

In terms of making sure to not have this project fail, I will help the team by keeping us on track to not be late and to be able to map out each goal small enough to be easily accomplished.
