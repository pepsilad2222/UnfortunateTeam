## Be Clear on What's Going to Give

### Important
- **Text-based Command System**: This must be intuitive and functional, allowing players to easily interact with the game world.
- **World and Story**: Since there are no visuals, the story and world need to be engaging enough to captivate players through text alone.
- **Core Mechanics**: Combat, movement, and other fundamental gameplay systems should be well-balanced and functional to provide an enjoyable experience.

### Not Important
- **Visuals**: Since the game is text-only, thereâ€™s no need to spend time or resources on graphical elements.
- **Overly Complex Puzzles or Environments**: Initially, focus on creating a simple, fun core experience. Adding complex puzzles or extra layers of difficulty can be considered later if time allows.
