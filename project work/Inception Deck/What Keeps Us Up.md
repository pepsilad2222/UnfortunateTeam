## Ask What Keeps Us Up at Night

### Command Parser Complexity
- Interpreting user inputs in a meaningful way can be challenging.
- To avoid complexity early on, limit user input to simple, predefined commands.
- Expand input options as the game progresses while maintaining intuitive control for players.

### Scope Creep
- A semester-long project may tempt us to add extra features (e.g., additional dungeon rooms, NPCs, or complex puzzles).
- To prevent derailment, we’ll stick to clear MVP (Minimum Viable Product) goals.
- Focus on completing the core game mechanics before considering any new features.

### Balancing Combat and Story
- Since the game is text-based, keeping combat engaging without visuals could be tough.
- Combat shouldn’t become repetitive or monotonous.
- We'll start by developing small, fun encounters to test how engaging text-only combat can be, iterating as needed for balance.

### Team Coordination
- Strong coordination is essential since this is a team project.
- Version control (using GitHub) will help avoid issues like merge conflicts or miscommunication.
- Regular check-ins will ensure both team members stay aligned on project progress and objectives.
