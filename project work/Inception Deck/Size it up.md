## Size It Up

Since most of the development will take place in the second half of the semester, weâ€™ll divide the timeline into three main phases:

### First 4-6 Weeks (Pre-production)
- Focus on design and planning:
  - Create dungeon and environment designs.
  - Define the major game mechanics (combat, movement, inventory).
- Decide and divide responsibilities between team members.
- Lay the groundwork for the command parser and game structure.

### Middle 6-8 Weeks (Development)
- Implement core gameplay features:
  - Build out the command system, movement, and combat mechanics.
  - Develop the main game engine and test early interactions between player and environment.
- Ensure basic features are functional and refine them as needed.

### Final 2-3 Weeks (Polishing and Testing)
- Finalize the story and add items such as weapons and potions.
- Test thoroughly for bugs and resolve any issues.
- Fine-tune gameplay balance and ensure the narrative flows smoothly.
