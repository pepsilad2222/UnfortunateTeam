## Show What It's Going to Take

### Time
Our time breakdown is detailed in the **Size It Up** section, but here’s the general plan:
- **First 4-6 Weeks (Pre-production)**
- **Middle 6-8 Weeks (Development)**
- **Final 2-3 Weeks (Polishing and Testing)**

### Cost
- **Development Tools**: We will use free tools, which should be sufficient for all development needs, resulting in no monetary cost.
- **Additional Resources**: Optional costs might arise if we decide to use third-party libraries for features like narrative generation, but this shouldn’t be necessary for a basic text adventure.
- **Overall Cost**: $0 for a basic, functional game utilizing free resources.

### Team
- **Team Members**: The current two-person team (you and your teammate) should be sufficient to cover all aspects of development and design.
- **Skills Required**:
  - **Java Proficiency**: Both team members need to be proficient in Java to handle key aspects like text parsing, object-oriented design, and game loop development.
- **Team Size**: A two-person team is ideal for managing the project scope, provided that tasks are effectively divided between team members.
