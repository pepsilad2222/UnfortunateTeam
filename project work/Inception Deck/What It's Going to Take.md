Show What It's Going to Take
Time:
Our time is more detailed in "Size it up" but the general plan is:
First 4-6 Weeks (Pre-production)
Middle 6-8 Weeks (Development)
Final 2-3 Weeks (Polishing and Testing)


Cost:

Development Tools: Free tools should be sufficient, meaning no monetary cost.
Additional Resources: Optional costs could arise if you use third-party libraries for narrative generation or extra features, but for a basic text adventure, this shouldnâ€™t be necessary.
Overall Cost: $0 for a basic, functional game using free resources.

Team:
You and your teammate are sufficient to cover all development and design work. 
Skills Required:
Java proficiency: Both teammates need solid Java skills to handle text parsing, object-oriented design, and game loop development.
Team Size: Your two-person team should be able to handle the scope, assuming you divide tasks effectively.
